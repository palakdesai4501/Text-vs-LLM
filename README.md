# Classification of Human Written and Artificial Intelligence Generated Texts

## Introduction
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in natural language processing, presents a pressing challenge: discerning between texts written by humans and those generated by AI systems. As AI-generated text increasingly resembles human-authored content, the need to differentiate between the two becomes paramount. 

## Motivation
In response to this challenge, our project aims to develop robust classification models capable of accurately identifying the origin of textual content. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we seek to address the escalating risks of misinformation and uphold the integrity of digital content across various domains such as journalism, academia, and legal matters. Through the fusion of Word2Vec embeddings and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), our approach emphasizes efficient feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. By enhancing detection accuracy and computational efficiency, we strive to provide reliable tools for verifying the authenticity of digital content in an era dominated by AI-driven text generation.

## Repository Structure
- **Notebooks**:
  - **Feature Extraction - Human vs LLM:** We utilize Word2Vec embeddings and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract features from the generated data.
  - **Binary Classification Human vs LLM:** This section contains the code for conducting binary classification on the prompts to distinguish between AI-generated and human-written text.
  - **Multi-Class Classification Human vs LLM:** Here, you'll find the code for performing multi-class classification to identify the specific LLM model from which the AI-generated text originates. We consider 5 LLM classes.
  - **Human vs LLM Pipeline:** This section houses our final pipeline, designed to take user input and determine whether the given text is AI-generated or human-written. If it's AI-generated, we provide information about the likely LLM model.
  - **Playground Notebook - Human vs LLM:** Explore our playground notebook for further experimentation and analysis in the context of distinguishing between human and LLM-generated text.
  
- **Environment**:
  Holds the packages used for training, evaluation, and development of our model.
